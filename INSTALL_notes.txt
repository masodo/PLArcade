Installation notes 3/25/2021:

Installing is a little tricky working from this distribution zip file, but with a little perserverence you will be able to get it going using the following basic instructions:

Create folder on remote system for root install site and have a blank mysql database available with known hostname, username, database name and password.

If you have an existing website you will be creating the ARCADE and FORUM folders in the site's root.                                                                                                                       
Copy "/ARCADE/" folder into site root (755)
Copy "/FORUM/" folder into site root (755)

(note: does not score properly if installed in a subfolder of the site's root; ex. http://Site.com/subfolder/ARCADE so it is not recommended.)

Upload all remaining files and folders into site's /ARCADE/ folder (disregard *.zip files for now.)
Upload contents of PLArcadeStarterGames.zip into site's /ARCADE folder as (arcade/*.) 
Unpack "avatars.zip", "icon.zip", "images.zip", "emoticons.zip" & "categories.zip" to create those subfolders within site's /ARCADE folder.


After uploading the files - CHMOD 777 your:
  arcade_conf.php
  /arcade/ folder
  /arcade/pics/ folder
  /tmp/ folder
  /arcade/gamedata folder
  /skins/ folder (recurse into files and folders)
  /flat/announce.php
  /FORUM/config.php
  /FORUM/extensions/pun_attachment/attachments/ folder

Visit the site/ARCADE and click the link for "Begin installation"

Also:
Change line #112 of Functions.php to suit your setup:
<script src="http://YourSiteHere.com/ARCADE/ruffle/ruffle.js"></script>
Change line #24 of fullout.php to suit your setup:
<script src="http://YourSiteHere.com/ARCADE/ruffle/ruffle.js"></script>

As "admin" in FORUM install all available extentions & install the hotfix.

The PunBB FORUM is having some issues as installed. Research continues on better performance in this area and GIT will be updated with any further developments. The new users seem to have better luck than "Admin" when posting to the FORUMs you should probably create a user in the arcade to manage Posting duties there.

Thanks for trying this script and remember to visit http://practicallightning.com/ARCADE/ for a look at an example of the installed script.
